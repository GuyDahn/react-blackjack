This is a Blackjack game made in React.js using redux and styled components. The player places a bet and then chooses to HIT or STAND.
after the players turn, the dealer (game logics) will reveal the card and hit as long as the dealer has 17 in count.

My goal in this project was to create a fun, easy game, while implementing my newly acquired skills in React, Redux, Styled-Components and Posed animations library.

Demo: SOON
